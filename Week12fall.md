# Week 12

## What did you do last week?
- Completed a project/file on python dictionaries and U.S. medical insurance data. This project was better scoped than last week. It had 19 steps, 43 lines of code, and involved the following functions - .get(), .values(), .pop(), and .update(). I created a dictionary of dictionaries and completed multiple string concatenations with dictionary values.
  - This project seems like it's a primer for working with SQL queries and SQL databases, the dictionary layout and referencing was very similar to using a SQL query to access a table.
- Started the first 'portfolio project'. This project seems longer than the others. It uses a csv file of US health insurance data and a Jupyter notebook.
- Read an article on lambda functions and pandas (the next module after the porfolio project). 

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Given that the porfolio project will take some time to complete all steps and to really analyze/explore the data trends I'm going to round robin it with the next module on pandas. My plan is to rotate between the project and the module every 30min or so.
- My current plan/steps for the porfolio project are -
  - Import csv library
  - Create empty lists for the column data
  - Import the csv file into the Jupyter Notebook and add the column data to the respective list
  - Create functions to get metrics like average age and charge amount, region & gender breakdown, % of smokers & non-smokers to total population
  - Look at how smoking affects cost

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- This week was pretty smooth. I'm going to rotate between the first porfolio project and the pandas module.
