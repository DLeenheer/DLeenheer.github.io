# Week 2: September 1 - September 7

## What did you do last week?
- I explored my original project ideas, with the goal of picking one or two to focus on
  - AWS cloud or data cert (AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and/or AWS Certified Developer Associate)
  - Azure cloud or data cert (Azure Fundamentals and/or Azure Developer Associate)
  - Power Platform cert - I'm completing some of the Power Apps and Power Automate modules as part of my current data contractor role
  - Google data analytics cert
  - Google cloud certs - looks like there's a whole list of them
  - Codecademy BI Analyst 'career pathway' - looks like they have some projects included with this
- Although the AWS and Azure cloud and data certs are interesting I am worried that without my CS degree being completed that these certifications alone won't be enough to land a role in the next 3-6 months (which is my focus as I'm currently between jobs)
- The Power Platform certification with Microsoft is interesting. The learning platform they have is really good and I have enjoyed the modules I have already completed as part of the data contract work I'm currently doing. Looks like the Power Platform Fundamentals certification typically takes around 1 month of study at 10 hours per week (so 40 hours) and their Power Platform Developer Associate cert takes around 50 hours, so I would only be able to complete the first one of these to keep within the scope of this course.
- The Google Data Analytics certification is estimated to take around 155 to 181 hours, so that goes beyond the scope of this course.
- There's a Google Cloud Digital Leader certification estimated at 20-30 hours of study, a Google Associate Cloud Engineer cert estimated at 3 months with a part-time schedule, a Google Professional Cloud Architect cert estimated at 3-6 months, and a Google Professional Data Engineer cert estimated at 3-6 months of study.
- The Codecademy BI Analyst pathway is estimated at 50 hours, but has some clear deliverables like projects with Python, SQL, and using Python with matplotlib and seaborn.
  - As I'm confused on the others I decided to start this pathway this week, I was able to work through the intro material and completed 2 basic 'projects' in python (focused on health insurance and a basic trip planner), which was a good refresher and start to things.
## What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue on with the Codecademy pathway
## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None
## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I feel like I found a path forward but I'm worried that I am passing up on a good certification. Prof Craven - do you have any advice on which certification(s) to focus on? With the goal of being job ready for an entry level role in the next 3-6 months?
- I think my plan at this point is to complete the Codecademy pathway and then maybe the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, AWS Certified Developer Associate, or Azure Fundamentals certifications.
