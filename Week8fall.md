# Week 8

## What did you do last week?
- I was able to complete the following tasks for the round 2 technical assessment for the pro sports team. I wasn't able to fully complete the backend objectives but I still enjoyed trying.
  - Autocomplete section:
    - Completed draw.io flow diagram and system design written response
  - Backend setup:
    - I was able to get the server running but received a WARNING:django.request:Not FOund: / "GET / HTTP1.1" 404 2220 error.
    - Downloaded PostgreSQL
    - Created project database
    - Created schema app
    - Created user projectapplicant and reset user password to 'thunder'
    - Granted all on schema access to projectapplicant
    - Installed pyenv
    - Created project virtual environment with venv (when virtualenv didn't work after troubleshooting)
    - Set python version to 3.10.1 within env
    - Ran project env
    - Install requirements.txt - I originally downloaded this file from the repo and then cloned the repo later on
    - I was able to signup a server with pthon manage.py runserver but received 3 django.request errors
    - I was able to travel to /api/v1/playersummary/1 and view the sample JSON file with player data in my browser
    - I was able to create the players and teams tables within the project database and app schema

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Get back to the Codecademy pathway

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- This past week was unique with the second technical assessment/project, I will be able to focus on the Codecademy pathway next week and get back to the plan.
- I heard back from Quinncia, they reset the margins on my resume and that fixed the bullet point issue their software had with reading my resume, so if anyone else gets the 'can't read/find bullet points' issue with Quinncia try resetting your document margins.
