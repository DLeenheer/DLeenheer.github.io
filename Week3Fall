# Week 3

## What did you do last week?
- I worked on the BI Analyst pathway, projects included two different versions of a health insurance program (one based on an functions, the next on control flow, I think things build as you go).
- I completed my project proposal.
- I completed 3 posts on other classmates project proposals and responded to the comments on my proposal.
## What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue on with the Codecademy pathway
- Meet with CU Engineering Career Services to gain advice on the direction of this project and my job search as a whole.
## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently
## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I have an academic advising meeting scheduled with CU Engineering Career Services tomorrow, this should help steer the direction for this project/semester. I'll either stay on the current path or pivot some base on feedback.
