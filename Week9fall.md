# Week 9

## What did you do last week?
- Completed my mid-semester Project Update Report
- As part of the Codecademy pathway I completed the following tasks
  - Read an article about Anaconda
  - Downloaded Anaconda
  - Read an article about Jupyter Notebook
  - Completed mini project in Jupyter Notebook working with lists, len(), range(), list(), and zip()
	  - Zipped two lists together
	  - Found the length of the list with len()
	  - Generated 8 id numbers
	  - Zipped these id numbers to the list to complete the full list
  - Read an article on data acquisition and the different ways data is organized and available for use on websites like Kaggle or GitHub
  - Watched a video covering the Harvard Dataverse repository and how to search for and download data from it

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue on with the Codecademy pathway

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I have been fighting some sort kind of bug and have had a pretty decent cold since last weekend. This made completing things this week significantly more difficult but I was still able to get a lot accomplished. Next week should be much smoother.
