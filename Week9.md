# Week 9

## What did you do last week?
- Completed the first data analysis video.
- Reviewed documentation on Microsoft's website, focusing on the data fundamentals training.
- I also watched 8 videos in a video series on Microsoft's Azure Cosmos DB.
- Completed and submitted the Project Update report.

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Complete at least 2, hopefully 3, video courses in different topics in my Linkedin Learning pathway.
- Watch the remaining videos of the Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB video series.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- My process moving forward will be to complete one video course on a topic and then move to the next topic. I will circle back through the topics once I complete a course in each of the remaining topics.
