# Week 10

## What did you do last week?
- I completed the videos in the statistics section of my LinkedIn Learning pathway. The chapter quizzes for the second course on probability had questions on combinations and permutations, so it was a nice discrete math refresher.
- I completed three different modules on the Microsoft learning website and achieved a perfect score on each one. The modules are part of the training series for the Azure Data Fundamentals certification. Two of the sections were a two part mini series on fundamental relational data concepts and the third module was on the relational database services specific to Azure.

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Keep working on the Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals modules.
- Complete two courses in the LinkedIn Learning pathway and complete the section quizzes.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Last week was a good combination between the Microsoft Azure modules and LinkedIn Learning. I'm going to keep going with this combination.
