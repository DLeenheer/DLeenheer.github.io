# What did you do last week?
- Completed one of the R courses, there is now one left
- I downloaded R and RStudio and ran through the various activities after watching and then pausing section or section video.
- I got my personal website up and running

# What do you plan to do this week?
- Complete the last R LinkedIn Learning video
- Watch a quicker statistics video
- Update the formatting for my weekly update posts/ pages on my website. Currently the posts are just text vs. the formatting of the landing page that I want.

# Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

# Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I think my speed with the final R video will be much quicker. I have been walking through all the exercises from the previous videos, for the last video I will only run through the exercises that are completely new (ex. new function or technique).
