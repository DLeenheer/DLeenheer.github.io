# Week 7

## What did you do last week?
- Completed 3 hours of the the last R LinkedIn Learning video
- Updated the formatting for my weekly update posts/ pages on my website. The posts are now in the correct format (the key was to just link to the file name vs full url).
- Completed 3 rounds of resume editing and review on Quinncia
- Met with UC Boulder engineering career services - discussed job search strategies and current resume

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Watch the last hour of the last R video
- Watch 3 hours of the Data Analytics videos from my LinkedIn Learning path

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Stopping the videos less helped to work through the R videos. I think the other topics will take less time to watch/review.
