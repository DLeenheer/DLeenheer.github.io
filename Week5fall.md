# Week 5

## What did you do last week?
- I ended up getting the opportunity to complete a technical assessment for a software development internship. This assignment ended up taking 4 hours on Sunday, between creating a plan, coding things out, and then testing.
- I also have another interview tomorrow so I watched a couple videos on answering interview questions. I will also do additional prep tomorrow morning.
- I also helped create an application in power apps at my software development contractor role and have learned various things about how data is connected to and interacted with in applications that is applicable to this project.

## What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to get back to the Codecademy pathway.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Last week was a unique week that isn't typical so my plan is to just get back to the planned activities/ continue on with the pathway.
