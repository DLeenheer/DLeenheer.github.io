# Week 7

## What did you do last week?
- The second project for the sports team internship is much more detailed than I figured it would be. There are 3 parts to the project - 
  - a diagram flow and write up for an autocomplete function for an internal application - I used draw.io for the flow and completed a draft of the write up thus far for this component
  - a back end step by step build that has you downloading sql and hooking up their dataset to an API view, there's more to it but that is the base - they have provided prerequisite info for part of the setup  
  - a front end step by step process that makes a call to an API endpoint that returns the data needed. You are tasked with creating an interface that describes the data returned from the API, they are requesting screenshots of the UI put together.
- There is a requirement for 2 of the 3 parts to be completed, with the option of completing all 3.
- I also completed most of the life long learning resources assignment. I watched a Linkedin Learning video and completed a couple rounds of resume review with their ATS scanner. The reviewed returned some small suggestions, including adding my gpa to my resume (which I don't think is applicable for someone with 10+ of business experience - maybe I'm wrong?). The largest deduction was because the scanner couldn't read/find my bullet points, even though I'm using the standard dot/circle. I emailed them and they replied asking for a word doc version of my resume to review things. I emailed that back to them just now.

## What do you plan to do this week?
- The diagram and write up portion of the internship project took 4-5 hours to complete last week, I am going to attempt to complete as much of the other two components as I can. Everything is due on the 14th.
- I have another technical challenge/timed assessment to complete for a different internship, so I need to complete that by Tuesday. 
  - I found a LinkedIn Learning video on Python coding interview tips. I am going to review that alongside some of the code I have from previous classes and then complete the assessment this weekend.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Overall I think my process was successful. This week I will be juggling the second technical project for the sport internship and new coding assessment for the second internship. The Codecademy pathway will most likely be paused until the following week.
