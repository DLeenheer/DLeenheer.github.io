# Week 4

## What did you do last week?
- Continued on with the Codecademy pathway, I just passed the 30% complete mark (I'm not sure how accurate the % completion marker is though).
- Met with Brian on the CU Engineering Career Services, I shared my resume with Brian and revised it based on his comments.
- Posted comments and suggestions in Piazza on other classmates project proposal submissions.

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue on with the Codecademy pathway, there's a offplatform python project coming up according to the syllabus I will hopefully start this project this week.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- To increase the efficiency of the project I will try to complete more of the project over the weekend vs weekday mornings/nights.
