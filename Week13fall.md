# Week 13

## What did you do last week?
- I completed the first portfolio project. The project was created in Jupyter Notebook. What is the recommended way to display a Jupyter Notebook file on a website? I kept receiving an error when trying to download the final version via pdf. I decided to download a html version but can also download a python file.
  - Here's the final project version - [U.S. Health Insurance Analysis](https://dleenheer.github.io/us-medical-insurance-costs-starter.html)
- I completed a bunch of items in the pathway as well this week, 2 lessons, read a couple articles, and achieved 100% on both lesson quizes, here's a screen shot of the items completed - <img width="613" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3cf7024-38cf-4ceb-bf41-a4cb6585c645">

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Keep working through as much of the pathway as possible.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Rotating between the portfolio project and the pandas lessons worked perfectly. If any further projects take longer than an hour I'm going to switch to this rotation model.
