# Week 11

## What did you do last week?
- Completed module on python dictionaries
- Completed a python dictionaries project with hurricane data. This project was interesting but a bit of a tangent. The script file ended up being 195 lines of code, with 10 different functions/question answers. The data started as a grouping of different lists and ended with ten different functions to make ten different dictionaries (some of the dictionaries had full lists of data as the value of the key/value pair). I'm assuming they want you to get used to this style since it's similar to using SQL to get data from a data source.

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue on with the Codecademy pathway, I completed the python dictionaries module so now I'm onto another dictionaries project with U.S. medical insurance data, then a linear regression project, and a portfolio level project.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- This week was smoother than last week, but my plan is to put additional hours in next week.
