# Week 6

## What did you do last week?
- I participated in two one on one Zoom interviews/discussions as part of a University of Colorado Boulder virtual career fair via Handshake. Both calls were good experiences, they helped me gain more confidence and experience with video interviews.
- I completed multiple short tasks for the Codecademy pathway. I read a document and watched a short video on list comprehensions with python. I completed an exercise focused on lists, list comprehensions, and for loops with health insurance data. I completed a git bash install review. They had a walkthrough document and video. I read a quick article on Jupyter Notebooks, this was largely a refresher/review as they have come up in earlier CSPB courses. I also read an on anaconda & JupyterHub/lab.

## What do you plan to do this week?
- I plan to continue working through the Codecademy pathway.
- I have another coding project to complete, this project is the second deliverable for the internship that I submitted the technical assessment for. The technical assessment was successful.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- Overall I think my process was successful. This week I will be juggling the second coding project alongside the Codecademy pathway.
