# Lifelong Learning Resources Activity

- Course: CSPB Career Services Advisor Zoom meeting, Quinncia – website walkthrough video, resume AI scan/analysis and post-report resume editing
  - I met with Brian Hand with the Engineering career services team and discussed my job search and current resume.
  - I went to the Quinncia website (via the UC Boulder Engineering career services website) and watched the walkthrough video that discussed the overview of the website features, how to get started, the resume analysis feature, the post-analysis report and the different portions of the scoring, the AI interview feature, and the steps and components of the post video report.
  - I uploaded my current resume and edited it based on the report (I completed 2 rounds of this activity).
- Location: Zoom call, CSPB Career Services website, Quinncia website 
- Review: 
  - My conversation with Brian was informative and helped me plan my job search for the coming weeks. He also gave me some pointers on my resume. 
  - The Quinncia resume report was interesting and provided valuable feedback on how an ATS system would read my resume.
  - I received a silver medal score for the first round with 36 points lost for 12 red flags, and 31 points lost for 31 suggested improvements. The score breakdown was 60/80 for general, 60/70 for formatting, and 217/250 for content.
  - I received a gold medal score after editing with 3 points lost for 1 red flag, and 30 points lost for 30 suggested improvements.
  - Interestingly the AI scanner did not detect my bullet points. It also didn’t like that I called my experience section professional experience instead of work experience. I have a separate internships and events section, so this is why I had the first section labeled as professional experience. I edited both section headers.
  - I then made edits to the resume and tried again; the industry selected was Information Technology.
  - I also uploaded a pdf of my LinkedIn profile and had that analyzed as well.
  - I received a silver score for my profile.
