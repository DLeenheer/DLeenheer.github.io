## Project Proposal: Upskill in data analysis by completing the Business Intelligence Data Analyst career path on Codecademy, include videos on job searching and interview preparation via LinkedIn Learning

## Vision Statement: how will this project expand your professional skills and knowledge?
I am currently between jobs, so this project is focused on upskilling to make myself a better candidate. Currently I am leaning towards business analyst and data analyst positions as those roles are related to the project management and program management roles I have held in the past. I am also currently a Data Contractor with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. This role is a 3-month contract. I originally thought this role would be a data analyst/engineer focused position, but I have been assigned software development tasks and projects thus far. I still think that upskilling for analyst roles makes sense as the focus for this semester, but I will be adding in the modules that I complete as part of my contract as well for this project (which have been in the Microsoft Learning website, specifically Power Apps and Power Automate). My focus is upskilling my technical skills in whatever way makes the most sense so I am purposely keeping things open ended so that I can pivot accordingly. I will also periodically complete interview prep activities on Quinncia and LinkedIn Learning as part of my project.

## Motivation: why is this project important to you?
This project is important because the skills I gain will hopefully help me gain a role at a great organization soon. My project focus is purposely open ended to include data, software, and interview prep. All these activities will be key to securing a role and then being successful in it.

Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project. Remember that a total of 45 hours will be dedicated to the course and project over the 16 week (or 12 week summer) semester. You want to limit the scope of your project based on that time limitation.
My goal will be to finish or make significant progress with the Business Intelligence Data Analyst career path on Codecademy. I will post about the various lessons, quizzes, and projects I complete along the way. I will also complete interview prep activities on Quinncia and LinkedIn Learning throughout the semester.

## Risks to project completion, possibly including:
Given the open-ended nature of my project I do not see many risks to project completion. Not being able to complete a project/assignment in the Codecademy pathway might be a risk. The pathway has an estimated 50 hours to completion listed on their website. 

## Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above:
If I encounter a project that I am initially unable to complete I will reach out to the learning community/forum on the Codecademy website to gain insight and recommendations. The forum has sections for each topic. I will also investigate things online and utilize the piazza forum for this class for assistance/advice from fellow students and/or the professor.
The total number of hours listed for the pathway seemed like an initial risk but the first 33% of the pathway was either easy or previously completed as part of the other courses I have taken on the website to learn the basics of python and SQL. I was worried about starting my degree initially, so I completed some of the courses on Codecademy to test the waters and get a feel for coding.

## Project Assessments - provide a list of evaluation criteria for the project. Describe how you will know that your project is completed and that you have met your goals.
-	Complete or make significant progress on the Business Intelligence Data Analyst career path on Codecademy. This includes all lessons, quizzes, and projects. I feel that focusing on significant progress as the minimum benchmark keeps the focus of the semester on upskilling vs. being locked into a pathway.
  - Time permitting, I will explore further projects on the Codecademy website, such as projects involving R and RStudio.
-	I will complete 2-3 interview prep activities on Quinncia.
-	I will watch at least 3 LinkedIn Learning videos on interview prepping, job searching, and related topics.
