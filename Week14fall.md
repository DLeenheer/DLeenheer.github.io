## What do you plan to do this week?
- Complete the final report/paper for this class.
- Wrap up steps 8 through 12 of the page funnel visits project/lesson that I started this week.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I really enjoyed working more with pandas and dataframes. I think I will continue on with this pathway after the semester wraps up, maybe 1-2 hours a week pending available time after coursework.
