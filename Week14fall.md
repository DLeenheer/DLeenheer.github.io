# Week 14

## What did you do last week?
- I completed multiple items this week for the BI data analyst pathway - 2 lessons, 2 quizzes, read an article on dataframe merging with pandas, and completed step 1 through 7 of a third project (page funnel visits with dataframes and pandas). Here's a screenshot on my progress - <img width="613" alt="image of tasks completed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ae72ed-8307-449f-867e-499f7582df2d">

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Complete the final report/paper for this class.
- Wrap up steps 8 through 12 of the page funnel visits project/lesson that I started this week.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- My process this week was efficient, I worked through as many items in the pathway as time allowed. I think I will continue on with this pathway after the semester wraps up, maybe 1-2 hours a week pending available time after coursework.
