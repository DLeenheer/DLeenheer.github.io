# Week 10

## What did you do last week?
- Completed modules on data acquisition and python strings
- Data acquisition notes:
  - Got dataset through an API call
	  - Article covered URL structure/parts
	  - Made two API calls in browser to api.census.gov the first was total commuters count & commuters < 5min, the second was total commuters count & commuters > 90 or more min
	  - A two digit state code got added to the results automatically, it was really neat to see the relay in the browser
  - Module that walked through using python to get the data from the census.gov with 'import requests'
  - Seeing the data as text with .text and as json data with .json()
  - Walked through converting the data from json to csv with 'import csv' and writing the data to an empty .csv file
  - Imported the pandas library and used it to read the first few rows of the file with .head() and then renamed the columns
  - Imported numpy, used numpy.random.binomial() to simulate coin flips, assigned values for the number of coin tosses per experiment, the bias of the coin (ex. even is p=0.5), and the # of times the experiment is run
- Python string notes:
  - Completed medical insurance project with Jupyter Notebook, via Anaconda
	  - Covered python strings
	  - .replace()
	  - Counted the num of records with a for loop, printed the int in a print string message
	  - Lots of repetition with .split(), .append(), .upper(), and nesting loops
	  - Transformed and cleaned a dataset that started as a messy string, cleaned it, sorted it, and was able to conduct some analysis, like find the average BMI, print a list of the names of each record, and lists for ages and insurance costs
  - Complete cipher project with python via Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
	  - Caesar cipher - encode, decode, different shifts, and then brute force (all 26 letters)
	  - Vigenere cipher - uses keyword that repeats along the message, message and keyword passed into the decoder function
- Started a module on python dictionaries

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Continue on with the Codecademy pathway, there 's a project on linear regression and a portfolio level project on U.S. medical insurance next up after a module on python dictionaries and files

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- This week was smoother than last week with the cold mostly gone.
