# Week 8

## What did you do last week?
- Watched the last hour of the last R video
- Watched some of the data analysis videos
- I started a new data contract position. As part of my onboarding I have been getting up to speed with the different data and security tools within Microsoft's Azure suite. Some of this learning has taken place a bit outside work hours and directly relates to my goals for this class.

## What do you plan to do this week?
- Keep working on the data analysis videos. Complete the exercises alongside the videos if available, these were helpful when completing the R videos/training.
- Work in a video from another section as well.
- Review documentation on Microsoft's website, focusing on the data fundamentals training. 

## Are there any impediments in your way?
- None currently

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I think I might break up the videos in the remaining sections of the pathway. This way I can make sure that I at least visit each topic by the end of the semester.
